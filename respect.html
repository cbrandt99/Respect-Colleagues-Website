      <h1>What is Respect?</h1>
      <img src="C:\Users\chris\Documents\GitHub\Respect-Colleagues-Website\images\respect quote.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <p>When the word respect comes to mind what do you think of? A feeling of mutual trust? A role model to look up to? Or maybe even admiration for the work that someone does? All three of these examples are variants of what respect is, and it is one of the most important factors in effective teamwork.</p>
      <p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines respect for antoher as "esteem for the sense ofworth or excellence of a person." The first part of this definition, esteem, refers to having a positive opinion on someone based on what you have seen them do. Whereas the second half, an individual's sense of worth, refers to the skills that an individual may have, and the benefits that they can bring to a team from said skills. Then that leaves the third part of the definition, the sense of excellence of a person, which refers to a person's character, which is made from the values and principles that a person may exhibit.</p>
      <p>As to properly define what respect is, one must take all three portions of the difinition into consideration. To truly respect someone you must first have to form a positive opinion of the person for yourself by observing what makes them deserving of respect.The next step should be to see how the individual presents themselves and the skills they are capable of, by doing this you should be able to see how a person values themselves and further to form a positive opinion of them. Finally you should see what tyoe of morals the person has and how they act around others. I believe that if you follow these steps you can truly find some form of respect in any person.</p>
      <h1>Why is it Important?</h1>
      <img src="C:\Users\chris\Documents\GitHub\Respect-Colleagues-Website\images\-respect-and-trust-.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <p>When working on a team with new people there will be many challenges, not only from the project given to your group but also getting to know the abilities and personalities of your teammates. One of the most important factors on having a team work successfully together is that the members of the team share a mutual respect for each other. If people respect each other they will feel more open towards them and more willing to cooperate on a shared task. Rather than trying to do the majority of a project by themselves because they feel that the others on the team are not capable .Some key examples of how respect can improve teamwork are as follows.</p>
      <p>Respect will improve relationships among people. When you show respect to others they will be more inclined to show you the same respect as well, because of this you will be able to form relationships with others easier since they will have a better opinion of you.  Another valuable effect a team can gain from respect is trust. Respect plays a large part in building trust between people, by building trust on a team the members will be able to rely on the other members to complete the tasks given to them. Rather than have one person feel like they need to complete more work than what was assigned to them, which could happen if the members on a team do not trust each other to do the task that is given to each member. One more benefit a team can gain from respect is more efficient communication. When trying to share an idea it is extremely important to be able to properly communicate to your teammates your ideas, this can become problematic if another member of the group does not respect you or your opinions, in such a case they may simply ignore what you are trying to convey or not completely take your idea to heart. On the other hand if a teammate shares a respect of you they will be more willing to listen to any ideas you might have that could help the team and give proper feedback, instead of somebody who has a negative opinion of you who might be biased to your suggestions.</p>
      <p>By taking the previous statements into mind I hope that you too may start to see the importance that respect plays in a group environment. Finally I would like to end this by explaining why you should respect your colleagues.</p>
      <h1>Why You Should Respect Your Colleagues</h1>
      <img src="C:\Users\chris\Documents\GitHub\Respect-Colleagues-Website\images\one does not simply.jpg" class="img-fluid">
      <p>Straightaway after reading the above paragraphs, you should be able to see some of the positive effects respect brings to a team and why you should respect your colleagues. One of the simplest reasons to show respect to you colleagues, is that they will more likely show the same respect back to you. Continuing, another reason to show respect to your colleagues, is that they will be willing to work with you more often, compared to people who do not share a mutual respect with you. Finally one more reason to respect your colleagues is, showing respect to others will help to reduce stress on the team, because your teammates will be more comfortable around you and willing to listen to any input you might have on the task at hand. These reasons stated above are just a few of the many reasons that you should show respect to your colleagues, if you take the advice from this page I believe you will be able to make any team activity successful by simply showing respect to the others on the team.</p>
